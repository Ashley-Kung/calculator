Project: Create a functioning calculator.

Current functionality:
- The user can enter single digit numbers only - no nulti-digit numbers.
- The decimal "." button does not currently function.
- The user must start by clicking a number, an operator, a number, then "=". From there, the user must alternate clicking an operator, a single number, and "=" to continue calculations.
- Pressing "clear" will reset the calculator for new calculations.
- Pressing "clear" will also reset the calculator if the calculator breaks due to the user going outside the bounds of current functionality.

Future functionality, not yet implemented:
- The user can enter multi-digit numbers.
- The user can string together multiple operations before pressing "=" e.g. 7 + 89 / 3 * 2 = ...
- The user can enter decimal values using the "." button.
